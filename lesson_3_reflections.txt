When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - Show my repository to other people or cooperate with other people on the same repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - Maybe I want to stay at a special version or make some changes based on the special changes and the new changes on remote may break down my changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - Forks on GitHub will create a copy of others repository in my GitHub account and commits will push to my forked repository.
    - Clones will not push the commits to the repository which is cloned if I have no access.
    - Branches are different versions in one repository.
    - Use forks when I have no access to other's repository and after fork I can commit changes.
    - Use clones if I am the owner or collaborator of the repository.
    - Use branches when add some features or make experimental and do not want to affect the current branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    - Could see remote commits and compare with local branch, merge remote commits to local branch, resolve conflicts and push them.
